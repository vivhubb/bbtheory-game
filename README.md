# **ROCK~PAPER~SCISSORS~LIZARD~SPOCK**
## **~THE BIG BANG THEORY GAME~**

Welcome to [THE R.P.S.L.S. GAME](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/) website.

THE R.P.S.L.S. GAME site, as the name suggests, is a website which allows users to play a different version of the ROCK-PAPER-SSCISSORS game as it is presented in the American Sitcom called Big Bang Theory. According to [IMDB](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1256039/trivia/?ref_=tt_ql_trv) the game of "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" was invented by a software engineer named Sam Kass, who outlined the rules and hand gestures on his website in 1998. He, however, called it "Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard".

Upon accessing the website the user will be welcomed by a [Greeting Page](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/) which will display instructions of game rules using a picture and a link to a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8").

At this point the user will have two options to navigate. One of them being the link to the previously mentioned video and the other one will take the user to the [Game Page](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/game.html).
