# **ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS-LIZARD-SPOCK**
## -THE BIG BANG THEORY GAME-

Welcome to [THE R.P.S.L.S. GAME](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/) website.

THE R.P.S.L.S. GAME site, as the name suggests, is a website which allows users to play a different version of the ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS game as it is presented in the American Sitcom called The Big Bang Theory. According to [IMDB](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1256039/trivia/?ref_=tt_ql_trv) the game of "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" was invented by a software engineer named Sam Kass, who outlined the rules and hand gestures on his website in 1998. He, however, called it "Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard".

Upon accessing the website the user will be welcomed by a [Greeting Page](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/) which will display instructions of game rules using a picture and a link to a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8").

At this point the user will have two options to navigate. One of them being the link to the previously mentioned video and the other one will take the user to the [Game Page](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/game.html).

The WIREFRAMES for THE R.P.S.L.S. GAME website were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), initially to help visualize the project. The plans slightly differ from the website's final look due to developements and new ideas during creation.

### **SITE STRUCTURE**

[THE R.P.S.L.S. GAME](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/) website created for the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game has two pages.

* [Greeting Page](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/) which is the default loading page welcoming the user and displaying instructions and game rules.
* [Game Page](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/game.html) which is holding the game itself.

### **DESIGN**

#### TYPEFACE

The chosen font for the website was Cormorant SC, which falls back on serif. The choice was made due to the fonts nature of displaying the lowercase letters with an uppercase styling, while still showing the difference between the two. In my opinion the fonts' traits contribute well to the main purpose of the site's creation which is the game.

#### COLOUR SCHEME

The idea for the chosen colour scheme was initiated by the image from the [Greeting Page](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/) that visualizes the game rules. Furthermore, the presence of multiple colors are meant to represent playfulness suggesting "this should be fun".

[Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) was used for building the colour scheme and creating the colour palette.
