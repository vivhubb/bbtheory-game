# **ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS-LIZARD-SPOCK**
## -THE BIG BANG THEORY GAME-

Welcome to [THE R.P.S.L.S. GAME](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/) website.

THE R.P.S.L.S. GAME site, as the name suggests, is a website which allows users to play a different version of the ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS game as it is presented in the American Sitcom called The Big Bang Theory. According to [IMDB](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1256039/trivia/?ref_=tt_ql_trv) the game of "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" was invented by a software engineer named Sam Kass, who outlined the rules and hand gestures on his website in 1998. He, however, called it "Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard".

Upon accessing the website the user will be welcomed by a [Greeting & Game Rules Page](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/) which will display instructions of game rules using a picture and a link to a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8").

At this point the user will have two options to navigate. One of them being the link to the previously mentioned video and the other one will take the user to the [Game Page](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/game.html).

#### WIREFRAMES

The WIREFRAMES for THE R.P.S.L.S. GAME website were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), initially to help visualize the project. The plans slightly differ from the website's final look due to developements and new ideas during creation.

### **SITE STRUCTURE**

[THE R.P.S.L.S. GAME](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/) website created for the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game has two pages.

* [Greeting & Game Rules Page](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/) which is the default loading page welcoming the user and displaying instructions and game rules.
* [Game Page](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/game.html) which is holding the game itself.

### **DESIGN**

#### TYPEFACE

The chosen font for the website was Cormorant SC, which falls back on serif. The choice was made due to the fonts nature of displaying the lowercase letters with an uppercase styling, while still showing the difference between the two. In my opinion the fonts' traits contribute well to the main purpose of the site's creation which is the game.

#### COLOUR SCHEME

The idea for the chosen colour scheme was initiated by the image from the [Greeting & Game Rules Page](https://vivhubb.github.io/bbtheory-game/) that visualizes the game rules. Furthermore, the presence of multiple colors are meant to represent playfulness suggesting "this should be fun".

[Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) was used for building the colour scheme and creating the colour palette.

![Game area empty](/assets/readme.images/game-area01.png)

As soon as the user starts playing, both the Player zone and the Computer zone will display the choices and keep track of the scores.

![Game area](/assets/readme.images/game-area02.png)

Below the game area there are two sections displaying feedback messages for the user regarding the outcome of each round. The first section will display the rules applied for the choices made in the respective round while the second one will confirm who gets the score for that round.

![explain results section](/assets/readme.images/explain-results.png)

Under this section are displayed all the choices available for the user. The buttons are changing their color on mouse hover.

![Choices](/assets/readme.images/choices.png) &emsp;
![Choices on hover](/assets/readme.images/choices-hover.png)

Once the game is over and a winner is called, the buttons for choice options (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock) will be disabled and a Restart Game option will pop up.

![Game over](/assets/readme.images/game-over.png)

The overall look of the game area can be associated with a "robotic face" which fits well with the site's purpose (being a game) as well as with the theme of The Big Bang Theory, where most of the characters are geniuses and scientists.
